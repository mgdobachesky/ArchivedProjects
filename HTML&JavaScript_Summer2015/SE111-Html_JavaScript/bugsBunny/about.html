<p class="main_text">The carrot-munching star of Warner Brothers cartoons, Bugs Bunny was the most enduring American cartoon character of the 20th century. The star of the Warner Brothers cartoons, Bugs was a cocky, wisecracking, good-hearted hare who battled Elmer Fudd, Daffy Duck and other nemeses in dozens of animated short films. Bugs' debut as a star was the 1940 short A Wild Hare, where he first uttered his trademark line, "What's up, Doc?" </p>
<p class="main_text">Bugs Bunny is always a winner, he has guts, grace and courage. Heâ€™s fast, silly, smart, and he likes carrots and music!  Bugs Bunny is number one in everything he does. He has an Oscar, a star on Hollywood Blvd, and is always three steps ahead of everyone else.  Nobody ever beats Bugs Bunny. No matter what, Bugs can handle it!</p></td>
